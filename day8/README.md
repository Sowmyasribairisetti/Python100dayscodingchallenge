📝 Day 8: Function Parameters, Arguments, and Caesar Cipher Project
✅ What I Learned:
Function Parameters & Arguments
How to pass information into a function.
Positional Arguments vs. Keyword Arguments.
Default Parameter Values.
Return Statements.
How to write cleaner and reusable code.
Nested function calls and modular coding practices.
🎯 Project: Caesar Cipher
A simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

🔐 Features:
Allows encoding and decoding of messages.
Handles user input for direction, message, and shift amount.
Makes use of functions to handle encryption and decryption logic.
Keeps looping until the user decides to exit.
